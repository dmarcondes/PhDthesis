\title{ERM estimative of Markov model of length k}
\usage{
ERM_markov(train, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{train}{A data frame with the training data. Should have columns named x and y representing the input and output strings.}

\item{k}{Length of Markov Chain.}
}
\value{
A list containing the table with the estimated hypothesis and a function to predict the output of a given input.
}
\description{
Estimate the hypothesis that minimizes the empirical classification error under the Markov model of length k.
}
\details{
Receives the sequence values y and its past x, and returns the predictor of length k that minimizes the classification error in the sample x,y.
